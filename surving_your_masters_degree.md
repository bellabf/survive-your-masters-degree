# How to survive your master's degree (sort of)

- Know your resources:
    - What are the libraries that are available to you?
    - What are the tools that you can use for free as a student (i.e github, canva)?
    - Does your computer have the required resources for your classes? If not, what are the resources available at the university?
    
- Know your motivation:
    - What are you looking for in a master's degree?
    - What specific career goals are you aiming to achieve in the future, and how does it align with your long-term plans?
    - Imagine you got amazing grades and your degree at the end of the two years, but you are still unhappy/dissatisfied. What would be a reason for that?
    - Beyond academic success, what would make you genuinely happy and satisfied with your degree? What are the factors that drive your motivation?

- Learn how to manage stress
    
    You can still enjoy (and have fun!) while doing hard things.
    
    - When have you felt your best while working? What are the conditions that you need to be able to focus on your work?
    - When have you experienced joy and fulfillment while working on challenging tasks? What aspects of your work bring you satisfaction? Do you need positive feedback from others?
    - Have you had trouble procrastinating in the past? What are the factors that have contributed to that?
    - Have you had trouble concentrating in the past? What were the circumstances in which that happened?
    - Have you engaged with self-sabotage in the past? What are signs that this is happening? What were the contributing factors for this self-sabotage behavior?
    
- Act on what you learned about yourself.
    - Do you do better when you use a time block to study, a Pomodoro, goal-oriented, or something else?
    - Would you rather have an online calendar or a physical agenda?
    - Have you found that you perform better when studying alone or with a study group?
    - Would you rather break down tasks into smaller blocks, or do a list make you overwhelmed?
    
     
    
- Build your own path
    - What are the topics that interest you the most?
    - Have you talked to people who work in the field that you are interested in?
    - What are the activities that you imagine yourself doing in the field/job you are interested in? Does that match the experience of people who you have talked with?
    
- Take care of yourself
    - Don’t forget to check on family and friends outside of masters (you can even send reminders to yourself in case you need to!)
    - Don’t abandon hobbies and other non-academic related activities. What steps can you take to maintain a balanced life during your Master's program?
